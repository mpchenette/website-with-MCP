# website-with-MCP

## Steps


### Install MCP
1. As a one time setup, you will need the [Figma MCP Server](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP) installed in your VS Code instance to be able to complete this demo.
   1. To do this, add the appropriate config from the [MCP server's README](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your User settings `settings.json` file in VS Code.
   1. You will also need to create a PAT in Figma with the appropriate permissions to be included in the config
1. Once installed / configured, you will need to restart the MCP config for VS Code in the agent mode window.

### Create a design in Figma

### Use Agent Mode
1. Ask Copilot agent mode to "Could you please look at what I have selected in Figma, and use that to generate code and then apply the code to my website so my website's design and content looks exactly like my Figma design?" and be sure to include the URL to your design in your prompt.


And voila! You'd Figma design has been applied to the basic HTML text web page in this repo!
